<br>Project for the cource <b><i>Multi-Agent Systems</b></i> for the Academic Year 2016-2017

The aim of the project was to implement the most popular auction protocols and to compare them. The implementation was made in the JADE platform and an auction system with three participants, an auctioneer and two bidders, was constructed. The system supported the following Auction protocols:
-	English,
- Japanese,
-	Dutch,
-	First-price sealed bid,
- Second-price sealed bid.<br>
In addition, a complete GUI was implemented in order to help the user to observe the bidders’ strategies and the overall Auction’s flow. Moreover, as regarding the English Auction we implemented a strategy for the bidders.
 <br><br><br> The project was succesfully evaluated in February 2017 with score <b>2 /2</b>
